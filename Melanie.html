            <h2>about us</h2>
           <p id="passage"> Black skin melanin refers to the higher levels of eumelanin, the pigment responsible for dark skin tones. Eumelanin is a brown-to-black pigment that provides greater protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation, reducing the risk of sunburn, skin damage, and skin cancers. People with darker skin, due to their increased melanin production, have more eumelanin, which helps absorb and dissipate harmful UV rays. This evolutionary adaptation is thought to have developed in response to high UV exposure in regions with intense sunlight, providing both protective and cosmetic benefits. Melanin also plays a role in determining other traits, such as hair and eye color.</p>
